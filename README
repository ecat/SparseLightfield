INSTRUCTIONS FOR GRADER
========================

To reconstruct an image, run main.m. A sample lightfield called 'flowers_plants_1_eslf.png' is included in the package. 

Other lightfield images can be reconstructed by downloading them from lightfields.stanford.edu and placing them into the same directory as the main.m script. The filename provided to the function lightfield_reconstruction will also have to be changed.

For the reconstruction to finish in less than 2 minutes, the angularViewResizeFactor in lightfieldReconstruction.m should be larger than 30.

To change the reconstruction basis, the reconBasis in lightfieldReconstruction.m should be changed. These have been provided as comments for convenience. Note that the Haar Wavelets reconstruction requires that the Matlab Wavelets toolbox be installed.

The number of measurements can also be changed to vary the compression factor. Any number between 2-100 is acceptable. This can be done by changing numMeasurements in lightfield_reconstruction.m

Two figures will appear once the reconstruction has completed. The first figure shows a reconstructed angular view and the corresponding angular view of the original image. The second figure shows the middle angular view of the reconstruction as well as the top left angular view of the reconstruction. Ideally, these will be shifted versions of each other.
