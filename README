from the project home directory


To reconstruct an image, run main.m. A sample lightfield is included in the code. For the reconstruction to finish in less than 
2 minutes, the angularViewResizeFactor in lightfieldReconstruction.m should be larger than 30.


To change the reconstruction basis, the reconBasis in lightfieldReconstruction.m should be changed. Note that HaarWavelets requires that the Matlab Wavelets toolbox be installed.

The number of measurements can also be changed to vary the compression factor. Any number between 2-100 is acceptable.
